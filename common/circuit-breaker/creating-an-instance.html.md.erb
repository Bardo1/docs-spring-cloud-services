## <a id="using-cf-cli"></a>Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<%= partial vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_target %>

If desired, view plan details for the Circuit Breaker Dashboard product using
`cf marketplace -s`.

<%= partial vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_marketplace %>

Run `cf create-service`, specifying the service, plan name, and instance name.

<%= partial vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_create %>

As the command output suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the service instance. When the service instance is ready, the `cf service` command will give a status of `create succeeded`:

<%= partial vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_service %>

<%= vars.scs_creating_instance_discrepancy_1_3 %>

## <a id="using-apps-manager"></a>Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer. In the Marketplace, select **Circuit Breaker**.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_img_marketplace) %>

Select the desired plan for the new service instance.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_img_select_plan) %>

Provide a name for the service instance (for example, "circuit-breaker-dashboard"). Click the **Add** button.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_img_instance_name) %>

In the **Services** list, click the listing for the new service instance.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_img_service_successfully_added) %>

Click the **Manage** link.

   <%= image_tag(vars.scs_cbd_creating_instance_img_manage_link) %>

It may take a few minutes to provision the service instance; while it is being provisioned, you will see a "The service instance is initializing" message. Once the instance is ready, its dashboard will load automatically.

The Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance is now ready to be used. For an example of using a circuit breaker in an application, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/circuit-breaker/writing-client-applications.html">Writing Client Applications</a> topic.
