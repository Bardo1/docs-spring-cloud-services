To find the dashboard, navigate in <%= vars.scs_platform_name %> Apps Manager to the Config Server service instance's space, click the listing for the service instance, and then click **Manage**.

<%= image_tag(vars.scs_cs_using_dashboard_manage_link) %>

If you are using version 6.8.0 or later of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI), you can also use `cf service SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the Config Server service instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service cook-config-server

Visit the URL given for "Dashboard".

The dashboard shows the current health of the Config Server along with the JSON object used to configure its settings. You can click the **Copy to clipboard** button to obtain this object in a string format suitable for use in command lines.

<%= image_tag(vars.scs_cs_using_dashboard_updated_dashboard) %>

For the settings shown in the above figure, the button copies the following to the clipboard:

<pre class="terminal">
"{\"count\":1,\"git\":{\"uri\":\"https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config\"}}"
</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If the Config Server service instance has been configured to use any credentials or encryption keys, you will need to edit the text provided by the <strong>Copy to clipboard</strong> button and replace the masked values (<code>****</code>) with the actual values.</p>

If the Config Server encounters an error in attempting to load configuration from the configuration source or is otherwise unable to use the provided connection information, its dashboard will provide problem details, as shown in the example below.
