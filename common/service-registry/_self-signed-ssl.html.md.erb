## <a id="self-signed-ssl-certificate"></a>Add Self-Signed SSL Certificate to JVM Truststore

Spring Cloud&reg; Services uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication. If your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation is using a self-signed SSL certificate, the certificate will need to be added to the JVM truststore before your application can be registered with a Service Registry service instance or consume a service that is registered with a Service Registry service instance.

Spring Cloud Services can add the certificate for you automatically. For this to work, you must set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable on your application to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf set-env message-generation TRUST_CERTS api.cf.wise.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.cf.wise.com' for app message-generation in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage message-generation' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage message-generation
</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>CF_TARGET</code> environment variable was formerly recommended for configuring Spring Cloud Services to add a certificate to the truststore. <code>CF_TARGET</code> is still supported for this purpose, but <code>TRUST_CERTS</code> is more flexible and is now recommended instead.</p>

As the output from the ```cf set-env``` command suggests, restage the application after setting the environment variable.
