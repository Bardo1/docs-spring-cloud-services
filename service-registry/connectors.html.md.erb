title: Spring Cloud Connectors

To connect client applications to the Service Registry, Spring Cloud Services uses the [Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html), which discovers services bound to applications running in Cloud Foundry.

## Service Detection

The connector inspects Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which stores connection and identification information for service instances that are bound to Cloud Foundry applications, to detect available services. Below is an example of a `VCAP_SERVICES` entry for the Spring Cloud Services Service Registry.

```json
"p-service-registry": [
 {
  "credentials": {
   "uri": "http://R5KYq8:OAyQ0x4y@eureka-8982c70c-9ad1.wise.com"
  },
  "label": "p-service-registry",
  "name": "service-registry",
  "plan": "standard",
  "tags": [
   "eureka",
   "discovery",
   "registry",
   "spring-cloud"
  ]
 }
]
```

For each service in the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, the connector considers the following fields:

* `tags`: Attributes or names of backing technologies behind the service.
* `label`: The service offering's name (not to be confused with a service _instance's_ name).
* `credentials.uri`: A URI pertaining to the service instance.
* `credentials.uris`: URIs pertaining to the service instance.

### Service Registry Detection Criteria

To establish availability of the Service Registry, the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector compares `VCAP_SERVICES` service entries against the following criteria:

* `tags` including `eureka`
* `label` beginning with the `eureka` tag
