Before an application is bound to the Service Registry service instance, the dashboard reflects that there are "No applications registered".

To see applications on the Service Registry dashboard, bind an app that contains ```@EnableDiscoveryClient``` to the Service Registry service instance. Once bound and restaged, the dashboard will display each registered apps.
