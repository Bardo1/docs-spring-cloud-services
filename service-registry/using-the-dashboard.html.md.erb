title: Using the Dashboard

Before any applications are bound to the Service Registry service instance, the Service Registry dashboard will reflect that there are &#8220;No applications registered&#8221;.

To see applications listed in the dashboard, bind an application which uses ```@EnableDiscoveryClient``` to the service instance. Once an application has been bound to the instance, has been restaged, and has registered with Eureka, the dashboard will display it under **Registered Apps**.
