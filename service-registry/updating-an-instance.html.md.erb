You can update settings on a Service Registry service instance using the cf Command Line Interface tool.

The `cf update-service` command can be given a `-c` flag with a JSON object containing parameters used to configure the service instance. Parameters accepted for the Service Registry are listed below.

| Parameter               | Function                         | Example                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| <code>count</code>      | The number of nodes to provision | <code>'{"count": 3}'</code>      |
| <code>upgrade</code>    | Whether to upgrade the instance  | <code>'{"upgrade": true}'</code> |

To update a Service Registry service instance's settings, target the org and space of the service instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf target -o myorg -s development

API endpoint:   https://api.cf.wise.com (API version: 2.43.0)
User:           user
Org:            myorg
Space:          development
</pre>

Then run `cf update-service SERVICE_NAME -c '{ "PARAMETER": "VALUE" }'`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the service instance, `PARAMETER` is a supported parameter, and `VALUE` is the value for the parameter. To update a service instance and set the count of instances for running in high-availability mode, run:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service My\ Service\ Registry -c '{"count": 3}'
Updating service instance My Service Registry as admin...
OK

Update in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service My Service Registry' to check operation status.
</pre>

As the command output suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the service instance. When the update is complete, the `cf service` command will give a status of `update succeeded`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service My\ Service\ Registry

Service instance: My Service Registry

The service instance is now updated and ready to be used.
