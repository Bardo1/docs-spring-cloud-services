title: Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

## Overview ##

Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Pivotal Cloud Foundry enables Spring applications to take advantage of the Circuit Breaker pattern. Cloud-native architectures are typically composed of multiple layers of distributed services. End-user requests may comprise multiple calls to these services, and if a lower-level service fails, the failure can cascade up to the end user and spread to other dependent services. Heavy traffic to a failing service can also make it difficult to repair. Circuit Breaker Dashboard can help to prevent cascading failures and supply dependent services until the failing service is operable again.

The Circuit Breaker watches for failing calls to a service. If failures continue past a certain threshold, the circuit is &#8220;opened&#8221; so that calls fail automatically and are handled by a fallback mechanism until the service has had time to heal, at which point the circuit is tentatively closed (or &#8220;half-opened&#8221;) pending a successful call and then reset if a call succeeds or reopened if the call fails.

Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Pivotal Cloud Foundry is based on [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix), Netflix&#8217;s latency and fault-tolerance library.
