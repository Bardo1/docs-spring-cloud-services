title: Using the Circuit Breaker Dashboard 
---

To use the Circuit Breaker dashboard, bind an app that contains ```@HystrixCommand```s to the Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance. Once bound and restaged, the app will update the dashboard with metrics that describe the health of its service calls.

With the example app above receiving no load, the dashboard will display the following:

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-start.png") %>

To see the circuit breaker in action, use curl, JMeter, Apache Bench or similar to simulate load.

```
$ while true; do curl circuit-breaker-example.my-cf.com; done
```

Depending on the time, the example app will either respond with ```hello!``` indicating a sucessful service call, or ```goodbye.``` indicating that an Exception was thrown and the fallback method was used.

When service calls are sucessful, the circuit is closed, and the rate of calls per second and sucessful calls per 10 seconds is indicated.

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-closed.png") %>

When service calls begin to fail, the rate of failed calls is indicated in red.

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-opening.png") %>

When failures exceed their configured threshold (default of 20 failures in 5 seconds), the circuit is opened. The rate of short circuited calls is indicated in blue; these are calls that are going straight to the fallback method. There are still calls being made to the failing method at a rate of 1 every 5 seconds, as indicated in red; this is necessary to determine if sucessful calls can be made, and if the circuit can be closed.

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-open.png") %>

At no point does the example app return a non-200 response to the requestor.
