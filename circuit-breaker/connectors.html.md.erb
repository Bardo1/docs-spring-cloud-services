title: Spring Cloud Connectors
---

To connect client applications to the Circuit Breaker Dashboard, Spring Cloud Services uses the [Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html), which discovers services bound to applications running in Cloud Foundry.

## Service Detection

The connector inspects Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which stores connection and identification information for service instances that are bound to Cloud Foundry applications, to detect available services. Below is an example of a `VCAP_SERVICES` entry for the Spring Cloud Services Circuit Breaker Dashboard (edited for brevity).

```json
"p-circuit-breaker-dashboard": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "dashboard": {
      "uri": "http://hystrix-99dae898-35ef-4073-9d46-ab24e9dee6f0.black.springapps.io"
     },
     "stream": {
      "uri": "http://turbine-99dae898-35ef-4073-9d46-ab24e9dee6f0.black.springapps.io"
     }
    },
    "label": "p-circuit-breaker-dashboard",
    "name": "circuit-breaker-dashboard",
    "plan": "standard",
    "tags": [
     "circuit-breaker",
     "hystrix-amqp",
     "spring-cloud"
    ]
   }
  ]
```

For each service in the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, the connector considers the following fields:

* `tags`: Attributes or names of backing technologies behind the service.
* `label`: The service offering's name (not to be confused with a service _instance's_ name).
* `credentials.uri`: A URI pertaining to the service instance.
* `credentials.uris`: URIs pertaining to the service instance.

### Circuit Breaker Dashboard Detection Criteria

To establish availability of the Circuit Breaker Dashboard, the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector compares `VCAP_SERVICES` service entries against the following criteria:

* `tags` including `hystrix-amqp`
* `label` beginning with the `hystrix-amqp` tag
