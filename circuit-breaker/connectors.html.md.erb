To connect client applications to the Circuit Breaker Dashboard, Spring Cloud Services uses [Spring Cloud Connectors](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-connectors.html), including the [Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html), which discovers services bound to applications running in Cloud Foundry.

## <a id="service-detection"></a>Service Detection

The connector inspects Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which stores connection and identification information for service instances that are bound to Cloud Foundry applications, to detect available services. Below is an example excerpt of a `VCAP_SERVICES` entry for the Spring Cloud Services Circuit Breaker Dashboard (edited for brevity).

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "p-circuit-breaker-dashboard": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "dashboard": "https://hystrix-67b8d606-c287-4fb1-9b3f-bd5cb27a29b5.apps.wise.com",
     "stream": "https://turbine-67b8d606-c287-4fb1-9b3f-bd5cb27a29b5.apps.wise.com"
    },
    "label": "p-circuit-breaker-dashboard",
    "name": "circuit-breaker-dashboard",
    "plan": "standard",
    "tags": [
     "circuit-breaker",
     "hystrix-amqp",
     "spring-cloud"
    ]
   }
  ]
```

For each service in the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, the connector considers the following fields:

* `tags`: Attributes or names of backing technologies behind the service.
* `label`: The service offering's name (not to be confused with a service _instance's_ name).
* `credentials.uri`: A URI pertaining to the service instance.
* `credentials.uris`: URIs pertaining to the service instance.

### <a id="circuit-breaker-dashboard-detection-criteria"></a>Circuit Breaker Dashboard Detection Criteria

To establish availability of the Circuit Breaker Dashboard, the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector compares `VCAP_SERVICES` service entries against the following criteria:

* `tags` including `hystrix-amqp`
