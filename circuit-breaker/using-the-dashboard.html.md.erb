title: Using the Circuit Breaker Dashboard 
---

To see breaker statuses on the dashboard, push an application that uses```@HystrixCommand``` annotations and bind it to the Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance. Once bound and restaged, the application will update the dashboard with metrics that describe the health of its service calls.

With the &#8220;Agency&#8221; example application (see the <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/guide">&#8220;guide&#8221; repository</a>) receiving no load, the dashboard will display the following:

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-start-ii.png") %>

To see the circuit breaker in action, use curl, <a href="http://jmeter.apache.org/">JMeter</a>, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a>, or similar to simulate load.

<pre class="terminal">
$ while true; do curl agency.wise.com; done
</pre>

With the Company application running and available via the Service Registry instance (see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/circuit-breaker/using-a-circuit-breaker.html">Using a Circuit Breaker</a> subtopic), the Agency application will respond with a guide name, indicating a successful service call. If you stop the Company application, it will respond with a &#8220;None available&#8221; message, indicating that the method call failed and was redirected to the fallback method.

When service calls are sucessful, the circuit is closed, and the dashboard graph shows the rate of calls per second and sucessful calls per 10 seconds.

When service calls begin to fail, the graph shows the rate of failed calls in red.

<%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/dashboard-opening-ii.png") %>

When failures exceed the configured threshold (the default is 20 failures in 5 seconds), the breaker will open the circuit. The rate of short-circuited calls&#8212;calls which are going straight to the fallback method&#8212;is indicated in blue. The application is still allowing calls to the failing method at a rate of 1 every 5 seconds, as indicated in red; this is necessary to determine if calls are again succeeding and if the circuit can be closed.

The Agency example application never returns a status code other than `200` to the requester.
