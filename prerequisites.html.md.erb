<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Please ensure that your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation meets the below requirements before installing Spring Cloud Services.

## <a id="buildpack-requirements"></a>Buildpack Requirements

Spring Cloud Services is built using Spring Boot 1.4, which requires version 3.8 or later of the Java Cloud Foundry buildpack. The default Java buildpack---the buildpack at the lowest position of all Java buildpacks---on your PCF installation must therefore be at version 3.8 or later.

You can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) to see the version of the Java buildpack that is currently installed.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack                position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack_offline   1          true      false    java-buildpack-offline-v3.8.1.zip
ruby_buildpack           2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-cached-v1.6.19.zip
nodejs_buildpack         3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-cached-v1.5.15.zip
go_buildpack             4          true      false    go_buildpack-cached-v1.7.10.zip
</pre>

If the default Java buildpack is older than version 3.8, you can download a newer version from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and update Pivotal Cloud Foundry by following the instructions in the [Managing Custom Buildpacks](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html) topic. To ensure that the newer buildpack is the default Java buildpack, you may delete or disable the older buildpack or make sure that the newer buildpack is in a lower position.

If the default Java buildpack on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform is not at version 3.8 or later, you must specify an alternate buildpack that is at version 3.8 or later when installing the Spring Cloud Services product; see step 4 of the [Installation](/spring-cloud-services/installation.html) topic.

## <a id="product-requirements"></a>Product Requirements

Spring Cloud Services requires the following Pivotal Cloud Foundry products to be installed:

* [MySQL](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql)
* [RabbitMQ](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)

If they are not already installed, you can follow the steps listed in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/installation.html">Installation</a> topic to install them along with Spring Cloud Services.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If you enable the RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry product's SSL support by providing it with SSL keys and certificates, you must enable the RabbitMQ product's TLS 1.0 support; otherwise, the Spring Cloud Services service broker will fail to create or update service instances. See the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/configuring.html">Configuring the RabbitMQ Service</a> topic in the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html">RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation</a>.</p>

## <a id="security-requirements"></a>Security Requirements

You will need to update your Elastic Runtime SSL certificate as described in the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/security_config.html). Generate one single certificate that includes all of the domains listed below, replacing `SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD` with your system domain and `APPLICATION_DOMAIN.TLD` with your application domain:

* `*.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.APPLICATION_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.login.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.uaa.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`

If any of these domains are not attributed to your Elastic Runtime SSL certificate, the installation of Spring Cloud Services will fail, and the installation logs will contain an error message that lists the missing domain entries:

```
Missing certs: *.uaa.example.com - exiting install. Please refer to the Security
Requirements section of the Spring Cloud Services prerequisites documentation.
```

## <a id="domain-requirements"></a>Domain Requirements

If you are installing Spring Cloud Services version 1.4.0 or earlier, your Elastic Runtime deployment must have at least one shared domain available (see the [Shared Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#shared-domains) section of the [Routes and Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html) topic in the PCF documentation). If the Elastic Runtime deployment does not have at least one shared domain available, the Spring Cloud Services service broker is unable to deploy service instance backing applications.

In Spring Cloud Services version 1.4.1 and later, service instance backing applications can be deployed using a private domain assigned to the `p-spring-cloud-services` org. If there is at least one shared domain available in the Elastic Runtime deployment, service instance backing applications will be deployed using the first shared domain available. If there is not at least one shared domain available in the Elastic Runtime deployment, service instance backing applications will be deployed using the first private domain assigned to the `p-spring-cloud-services` org.

For more information about the Spring Cloud Services service instance backing applications, see the [Service Instances](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#service-instances) section of the [Operation Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) topic.
