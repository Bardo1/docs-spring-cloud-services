<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Please ensure that your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation meets the below requirements before installing Spring Cloud Services.

## <a id="buildpack-requirements"></a>Buildpack Requirements

Spring Cloud Services is built using Spring Boot 1.5 and requires version 4.5 or later of the Java Cloud Foundry buildpack. The default Java buildpack---the buildpack at the lowest position of all Java buildpacks---on your PCF installation must therefore be at version 4.5 or later.

You can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) to see the version of the Java buildpack that is currently installed.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack        position   enabled   locked  filename
java_buildpack   1          true      false   java-buildpack-offline-v4.5.zip
ruby_buildpack   2          true      false   ruby_buildpack-cached-v1.7.8.zip
nodejs_buildpack 3          true      false   nodejs_buildpack-cached-v1.6.14.zip
go_buildpack     4          true      false   go_buildpack-cached-v1.8.15.zip
</pre>

If the default Java buildpack is older than version 4.5, you can download a newer version from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and update Pivotal Cloud Foundry by following the instructions in the [Managing Custom Buildpacks](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html) topic. To ensure that the newer buildpack is the default Java buildpack, you may delete or disable the older buildpack or make sure that the newer buildpack is in a lower position.

If the default Java buildpack on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform is not at version 4.5 or later, you must specify an alternate buildpack that is at version 4.5 or later when installing the Spring Cloud Services product; see step 4 of the [Installation](/spring-cloud-services/installation.html) topic.

## <a id="service-requirements"></a>Service Requirements

Spring Cloud Services requires the following services to be installed:

* A MySQL service (Pivotal recommends [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) or [MySQL for PCF v2](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql) for use with Spring Cloud Services)
* [RabbitMQ for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)

If they are not already installed, you can follow the steps listed in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/installation.html">Installation</a> topic to install them along with Spring Cloud Services.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If you enable the RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry product's SSL support by providing it with SSL keys and certificates, you must enable the RabbitMQ product's TLS 1.0 support; otherwise, the Spring Cloud Services service broker will fail to create or update service instances. See the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-11/install-config-pp.html">Installing and Configuring the Pre-Provisioned Service</a> topic in the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html">RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation</a>.</p>

### <a id="isolating-rabbitmq"></a>Isolating RabbitMQ Cluster for Spring Cloud Services

Using RabbitMQ for PCF version 1.9 or later, you can isolate the RabbitMQ cluster used for Spring Cloud Services from clusters used by other applications running on PCF. This eliminates the "noisy neighbor" problem produced by an application consuming too many resources from a given shared cluster. For information about isolating the RabbitMQ cluster for Spring Cloud Services, see the [Running SCS on a Dedicated RabbitMQ Cluster](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-11/replicator.html#scs-isolation) section of the [Creating Isolation with the RabbitMQ for PCF Replicator](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-11/replicator.html) topic in the [RabbitMQ for PCF documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-11/).

## <a id="security-requirements"></a>Security Requirements

You will need to update your Elastic Runtime SSL certificate as described in the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/security_config.html). Generate one single certificate that includes all of the domains listed below, replacing `SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD` with your system domain and `APPLICATION_DOMAIN.TLD` with your application domain:

* `*.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.APPLICATION_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.login.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`
* `*.uaa.SYSTEM_DOMAIN.TLD`

If any of these domains are not attributed to your Elastic Runtime SSL certificate, the installation of Spring Cloud Services will fail, and the installation logs will contain an error message that lists the missing domain entries:

```
Missing certs: *.uaa.example.com - exiting install. Please refer to the Security
Requirements section of the Spring Cloud Services prerequisites documentation.
```
