title: Installing Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

# Prerequisites

Spring Cloud Services requires the following Pivotal Cloud Foundry products:

* [MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql)
* [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)

If they are not installed, you can follow the installation instructions below to install them along with Spring Cloud Services.

Spring Cloud Services also requires version 2.5 or greater of the Java buildpack to be the default Java buildpack on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform. You can use the cf Command Line Interface tool to see the version of the Java buildpack that is currently installed.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack                position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack_offline   1          true      false    java-buildpack-offline-v2.7.1.zip
ruby_buildpack           2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-cached-v1.3.0.zip
nodejs_buildpack         3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-cached-v1.2.0.zip
</pre>

If the default Java buildpack is older than version 2.5, you can download a newer version from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and update Pivotal Cloud Foundry by following the instructions in the [Adding Buildpacks to Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html) topic. If you do not delete or disable the older Java buildpack, make sure that the newer Java buildpack is in a lower position so that it will be the default.
