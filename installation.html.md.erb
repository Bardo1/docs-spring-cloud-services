Make sure that you have or have completed all products and requirements listed in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/prerequisites.html">Prerequisites</a> topic. Then follow the below steps to install Spring Cloud Services.

## Installation Steps

1. Download Spring Cloud Services from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. In the Installation Dashboard of [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Operations Manager, click **Import a Product** on the left sidebar to upload the Spring Cloud Services `.pivotal` file.

    The **Service Instance Limit** setting sets the maximum number of service instances that the Spring Cloud Services service broker will allow to be provisioned (the default value is 100). This setting's value is also used to determine the memory quota for the org in which service instances are deployed; that org's quota will be equal to 1.5G times the configured service instance limit. The **Buildpack** setting is the name of the Java buildpack that the Spring Cloud Services service broker will use to provision service instances (if this setting is left empty, the broker will use the default Java buildpack to provision service instances). By default, Spring Cloud Services validates the Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Elastic Runtime SSL certificate. In case of a complex certificate configuration in load balancers or in your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment, you can check the **Do not validate that SSL certificates are properly configured** checkbox to disable this validation.
