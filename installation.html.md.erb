title: Installing Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

# Prerequisites

Spring Cloud Services requires [MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) and [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service). If they are not installed, you can follow the same installation instructions below to install all products at the same time.

Spring Cloud Services requires **Java Buildpack version 2.5 or greater** to be the default Java Buildpack on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform. You can use the `cf` Cloud Foundry CLI command `cf buildpacks` to see the version of the Java Buildpack that is currently installed. If the default Java Buildpack is older than version 2.5, you can download a newer version from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and update Pivotal Cloud Foundry following the instructions in the [Administration guide](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html). You can delete the older Java Buildpack, disable it, or just make sure the newer Java Buildpack is in a lower position to make it the default.
