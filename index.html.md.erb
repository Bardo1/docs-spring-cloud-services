title: Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry packages server-side components of <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/">Spring Cloud</a> projects, such as <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> and <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/">Spring Cloud Config</a>, and makes them available as services in the Marketplace. This frees you from having to implement and maintain your own managed services in order to use the included projects. Taking advantage of these battle-tested patterns, and of the libraries that implement them, can now be as simple as including a starter POM in your application&#8217;s dependencies and applying the appropriate annotation.
