## <a id="product-upgradeability"></a>Product Upgradeability

Please see the relevant section below for important information regarding upgrades of the Spring Cloud Services product on your version of Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;.

### Upgrades on Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; 1.6

When upgrading to a patch version of the Spring Cloud Services (SCS) product on Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; 1.6, you must consecutively apply all patch versions between your currently-installed SCS version and the version to which you wish to upgrade, and you may not skip a patch version. For example, you may not upgrade SCS 1.0.6 directly to SCS 1.0.8; instead, to upgrade SCS 1.0.6 to SCS 1.0.8, you must upgrade SCS 1.0.6 to SCS 1.0.7, then upgrade SCS 1.0.7 to SCS 1.0.8.

### Upgrades on Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; 1.7

On Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; 1.7, you may not upgrade any version of the Spring Cloud Services product between 1.0.0 and 1.0.8 to any version older than 1.0.9 (e.g., you may not upgrade SCS 1.0.1 to SCS 1.0.2); however, you may upgrade any of these versions directly to 1.0.9 or later. You may upgrade any patch version of SCS after 1.0.9 directly to any later patch version and need not apply any intervening patch versions.

## <a id="service-instance-upgrade-steps"></a>Service Instance Upgrade Steps

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Use of <code>cf update-service</code> to upgrade service instances is available only in Spring Cloud Services 1.0.4 and later.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: In the current version of Spring Cloud Services, upgrading a service instance will result in downtime for the instance while the upgrade is completed.</p>

After upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, follow the below steps to upgrade an individual service instance.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If you have client applications which work with Spring Cloud Services 1.0.x service instances and are upgrading these service instances to 1.1.x, you must update your client applications to use the current version of the Spring Cloud Services client dependencies. See <a href="#client-application-changes-in-1-0-x">Client Application Changes in 1.1.x</a> below.</p>

1. To see the current version of a service instance, visit the Service Instances Dashboard. (See the [Service Instances Dashboard](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#service-instances-dashboard) section of the [Operator Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) subtopic.)

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrades/si-dashboard-pre-upgrade.png") %>

1. Run `cf update-service -c '{"upgrade":true}' SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of a service instance:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service -c '{"upgrade":true}' config-server
    Updating service instance config-server as user...
    OK
    </pre>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>cf update-service</code> command begins the upgrade process. The actual upgrade may not have finished when the command exits.</p>

1. Wait while any backing applications belonging to the service instance are upgraded. The Dashboard will show the `RESTARTING` status for the instance.

1. When the service instance has been upgraded, the Dashboard will show the new version.

## <a id="client-application-changes-in-1-0-x"></a>Client Application Changes in 1.1.x
    
The client dependencies for Spring Cloud Services were restructured in Spring Cloud Services version 1.1.0. In particular, the `spring-cloud-services-starter-parent` has been replaced with a `spring-cloud-services-dependencies` Maven BOM (<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies">Bill of Materials</a>), which does not include the Spring Cloud or Spring Boot dependency BOMs.

If your client applications are using dependencies corresponding to a 1.0.x version of Spring Cloud Services, you must update them to use the 1.1.0 BOM and include the other requisite dependencies. See the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a> topic for details on the current client dependencies.
