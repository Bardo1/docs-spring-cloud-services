Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="1-4-0-migrating-from-1-3-x"></a>Migrating from 1.3.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.3.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

## <a id="1-4-0-migrating-from-1-2-x"></a>Migrating from 1.2.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.2.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

## <a id="1-4-0-migrating-from-1-1-x"></a>Migrating from 1.1.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.1.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

## <a id="1-4-0-migrating-from-1-0-x"></a>Migrating from 1.0.x

The Spring Cloud Services client dependencies were restructured in 1.1.0. In 1.3.x, they are based on Spring Cloud Camden. To ensure compatibility of your client applications with Spring Cloud Services 1.3.x service instances, you must update your client applications to include the current dependencies and the Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Maven BOM dependencies. For information about upgrading Spring Cloud Services service instances after upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/1-3/common/service-instance-upgrades.html">Service Instance Upgrades</a> topic. For complete information about the current Spring Cloud Services client dependencies, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/1-3/common/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a>.

After upgrading a 1.0.x Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance to a 1.3.x version, you must unbind, rebind, and restart any client applications which were bound to the instance. This is due to a change in how service instance credentials are managed.

## <a id="1-4-1"></a>1.4.1

**Release Date: 28th June 2017**

Enhancements included in this release:

* Messages sent by Circuit Breaker Dashboard to its RabbitMQ service instance now have a Time To Live (TTL) set, to prevent overloading of the RabbitMQ queue.
* The Spring Cloud Services service broker now can use a private domain to deploy service instance backing applications when no shared domains are available in the Elastic Runtime deployment. For more information, see the [Domain Requirements](/spring-cloud-services/prerequisites.html#domain-requirements) section of the [Prerequisites](/spring-cloud-services/prerequisites.html) topic.

Fixes included in this release:

* Fixed a Config Server issue which could prevent backing application startup and resulted in backing application log and dashboard errors when the service instance was configured to connect to a Git repository via SSH.
    
## <a id="1-4-0"></a>1.4.0

**Release Date: 29th May 2017**

<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you are using <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/trusted-system-certificates.html">Trusted System Certificates</a>, do not install or upgrade to Spring Cloud Services 1.4.0. See "Known issues" below.</p>
<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you have upgraded to Spring Cloud Services version 1.4.0 but have a Config Server service instance which accesses a Git repository via SSH and has not yet been upgraded, do not upgrade the service instance at this time. See "Known issues" below.</p>

Enhancements included in this release:

* The Config Server now can use a HashiCorp Vault server as a configuration source, directly or through an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. For more information, see the [Configuring with Vault](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/configuring-with-vault.html) topic in the [Config Server](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) documentation. In order to use the Vault support in a client application, you must update your application's Spring Cloud Services client dependencies; see the [Client Dependencies](/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html) topic.
* The Config Server now can use a composite backend comprising one or more Git repositories and up to one HashiCorp Vault server. For more information, see the [Composite Backends](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/composite-backends.html) topic in the [Config Server](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) documentation.
* The Config Server's `/health` endpoint, provided by Spring Boot Actuator, now displays failure information when the Config Server cannot use the provided configuration or otherwise encounters an error. For information about accessing this endpoint, see the [Access Actuator Endpoints](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#access-actuator-endpoints) section of the [Operator Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) topic.
* The Config Server's backing application now logs failure information when the Config Server cannot use the provided configuration or otherwise encounters an error. For information about accessing the backing application logs, see the [Read Backing Application Logs](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#backing-application-logs) section of the [Operator Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) topic.
* The Config Server dashboard now displays detailed failure information when the Config Server cannot use the provided configuration or otherwise encounters an error. For more information, see the [Using the Dashboard](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/using-the-dashboard.html) topic in the [Config Server](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) documentation.
* The Spring Cloud Services service broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 1.5.2 and Spring Cloud Dalston.RELEASE.

Known issues in this release:

* uaac commands used by Spring Cloud Services lifecycle errands fail if Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Operations Manager has been configured to use Trusted System Certificates (for example to support an internal root Certificate Authority). If you are using Trusted System Certificates, do not install or upgrade to this release. If you have already installed it following the tile installation process rather than the tile upgrade process, uninstall and delete the tile; if you have already upgraded to this release, please contact [Pivotal Support](https://pivotal.io/support) for assistance.
* A Config Server service instance which has a configuration source consisting of a Git repository reached via SSH may fail to start, will report a status of `DOWN` on its `health` endpoint (provided by Spring Boot Actuator), and will report on its dashboard that it "cannot initialize using the configuration that has been provided". The backing application logs for the service instance may contain the phrases `reject HostKey` or `ssh protocol is not supported`.
<br/> <br/>
If you have upgraded Spring Cloud Services to version 1.4.0 but have a Config Server service instance which accesses a Git repository via SSH and has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, do not upgrade the service instance at this time. If you have such a service instance and it has been upgraded, follow the below steps to enable the Config Server to start (this will not correct the status given on the `health` endpoint or the dashboard message).
  * Locate the backing application for the service instance (see the [Service Instances](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#service-instances) section of the [Operator Information](/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html) topic).
  * Run `cf env [APPNAME]`, where `APPNAME` is the name of the backing application. From the output, copy the value of the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` environment variable.
  * Within the `spring.cloud.config.server.git` object for the relevant Git configuration source, add a property `strictHostKeyChecking` with value `false`. Use `cf set-env` to set the new environment variable value: `cf set-env config-xxx-xxx-xxx SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON '{"spring":{"cloud":{"config":{"server":{"git":{"strictHostKeyChecking":false, "uri:"...", "privateKey":"...", ...}'`
  * Restage the backing application.
* Spring Cloud Services is affected by an [issue in Spring Boot version 1.5.3](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9079) and is not compatible with that version. To be compatible with this release of Spring Cloud Services, client applications should use Spring Boot versions 1.5.0--1.5.2 or 1.5.4 and later.
* A Config Server service instance which has a configuration source consisting of a Git repository defined using placeholders (see the [Placeholders in Repository URIs](/spring-cloud-services/common/config-server/configuring-with-git.html#placeholders-in-repository-uris) section of the [Configuring with Git](/spring-cloud-services/configuring-with-git.html) topic in the [Config Server](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) documentation) always clones that repository's data to a location under the system temporary directory, which can be periodically emptied, causing a loss of cloned configuration data. By default, the Spring Cloud Services Config Server does not clone repository data under the temporary directory. To ensure that repository data is cloned elsewhere, do not use placeholders in a Git repository URI with this release.
* A client application using RabbitMQ and bound to a Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance may fail to start up. This is due to an issue in the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ binder. The issue is resolved in the binder's version 1.2.1; this release of Spring Cloud Services depends on Spring Cloud OSS Dalston.RELEASE, which includes the binder's version 1.2.0.
<br/> <br/>
If you wish to use RabbitMQ with a Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance, you must manually override either the version of the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ binder used by your application or the version of the Spring Cloud Maven BOM used by your application (the 1.2.1 release of the binder is included in Spring Cloud OSS Dalston.SR1).
<br/> <br/>
    Using Gradle:

    ```groovy
    // Override managed version of Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ binder
    compile ("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit:1.2.1.RELEASE")

    // Override version of OSS Spring Cloud
    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
            mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-dependencies:Dalston.SR1"
        }
    }
    ```

    Using Maven:

    ```xml
        <!-- Override managed version of Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ binder -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.1.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>

        <!-- Override version of OSS Spring Cloud -->
        <dependencyManagement>
          <dependencies>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                  <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
                  <version>Dalston.SR1</version>
                  <type>pom</type>
                  <scope>import</scope>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
        </dependencyManagement>
    ```
