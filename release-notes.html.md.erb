Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: The service broker applications in Spring Cloud Services 2.0 use the <code>system</code> org's system domain, and expect this domain to be a shared domain (the default setting). If you make the <code>system</code> org's system domain private, Spring Cloud Services 2.0 will fail to push applications to the <code>system</code> org.</p>
